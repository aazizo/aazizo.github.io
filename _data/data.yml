    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am currently an R&D Senior Software Engineer at Sandia National Laboratories,
      I received a M.S. in Computer Science from Baghdad University in 2003 and a Ph.D. 
      from New Mexico State University in 2018. I worked at Baghdad University in Baghdad-Iraq, 
      eventually as an instructor from 2003 to 2009. My research interests are in 
      High-Performance Computing (HPC), specifically in dynamic analysis, application 
      performance, and runtime monitoring. In the HPC arena, I developed a several statistical module 
      to improve the scientafic application performance.
      My current research focuses on studying the increase of the overall utility of 
      expensive HPC resources in a scientific application and analyze the behavior
      patterns of parallel applications, using statistical and numerical techniques.
