    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Currently, I am a Research and Development Computer Scientist at Sandia National Laboratories,
      where I develop technology to solve scientifically challenging problems, and I am also an Adjunct
      Faculty at the University of New Mexico where I teach Computer Networks.
      I received a M.S. in Computer Science from Baghdad University in 2003 and a Ph.D. 
      from New Mexico State University in 2018. I worked at Baghdad University in Baghdad-Iraq, 
      eventually as an instructor from 2003 to 2009. My research interests are in 
      High-Performance Computing (HPC), specifically in dynamic analysis, application 
      performance, and runtime monitoring. In the HPC arena, I used several statistical 
      and machine learning modules to improve scientific application performance.
      My current research focuses on studying the increase of the overall utility of 
      expensive HPC resources in a scientific application and analyze the behavior
      patterns of parallel applications.

      company: Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque
      details: |
        - Explored several machine learning techniques to predict and diagnose performance anomalies in production HPC applications
        - Developed methodologies use machine learning to predict the overall performance of running scientific applications instantly to improve Sandia supercomputing fertility
        - Performed variance thresholding and cross-correlation on terabytes of time-series HPC system data for dimensionality reduction and identification of performance botelnecks 
        - Developed analytics for network intrusion detection through Sandia-designed software in coordination with government agencies
        - Lead a team of four undergraduate and graduate students at New Mexico State University to design a GPU analytic framework to detect performance deterioration in heterogeneous applications
        - Applied data analytics to characterize communication patterns to find the behavior relationship between real and proxy applications and discover their correspondence or divergence
        - Advanced monitoring and analysis capabilities for HPC systems by incorporating Lightweight Distributed Metric Service (LDMS), a supercomputer metric collection service, into Sandia testbeds
        - Organized, led, and presented at a data analytics meeting between members of Sandia, Los Alamos, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories centered on HPC systems
        - Collaborated with scientists from Oak Ridge National Laboratory as a member of the ECP project, to improve the quality of current scientfic applications and maximize the benefit received from their use
