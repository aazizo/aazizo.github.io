      details: |
          - Studied the behavior patterns of parallel scientific applications using 
          statistical and numerical techniques.
          - Created a new mechanism to collect hardware counters from applications 
          running on production clusters with less than 1% runtime overhead to discover 
          performance drawbacks.
           - Desing and implemented a framework to automatically monitor and predict the 
           performance, load balance of parallel applications.
           - Designed a production monitoring framework that is capable of collecting 
          performance data from applications run on large scale clusters. Also measured 
          the impact of the message size on the MPI applications communication 
          performance.
